Changelog
=========

0.5.0 (2010-02-28)
------------------

* Cleaned base code. We are now fully pep8 compliant.

* ``dolmen.blob`` now has its own ``zope.filerepresentation``
  adapters, in order to use the natural getters and setters. We no
  longer need to include ``zope.file`` in the `configure.zcml`, as
  ``dolmen.blob`` now provides all the needed components to be
  independant.

* Echoed ``dolmen.file`` changes and dropped ``zope.app.file`` support.

* Dependency cleaned. Had to retain ``zope.app.testing`` and
  ``zope.app.appsetup`` since we need the ZODB support for the
  tests. All other zope.app dependencies have been severed.


0.4.1 (2009-11-18)
------------------

* Now using Grok 1.1a1 versions.

* zope.copy is no longer pinned down to version 3.5 but to 3.5 and
  greater.


0.4 (2009-11-09)
----------------

* Added ICopyHook for ZODB.interfaces.IBlob objects. Now the data is
  copied using `zope.copy`.


0.3 (2009-11-08)
----------------

* Added Blob to Blob copy, using a new storage. Added tests for this
  new storage.


0.2.1 (2009-10-23)
------------------

* Corrected a bug of a variable used when not defined, if a mimeType
  was given using the contentType argument at the BlobValue creation.
  Added a test to fix this behavior.


0.2 (2009-10-23)
----------------

* Added a bunch of new tests for the compatibility with the new
  packages used.

* A new access view is available for `IBlobFile` objects, returning a
  `zope.file.download.DownloadResult`. This access view also uses
  an adapter to `zope.mimetype.interfaces.IContentInfo` to get the
  header values.

* `IBlobFile` now inherits from `zope.file.interfaces.IFile`. This
  brings in a lot of new features, including the compatibility with
  the `zope.mimetype` package and its adapters.

* `dolmen.blob` now proposes a non `Persistent` blob, called
  BlobValue. It allows to have object storing an attribute value in a
  blob, without getting an independant connection to the database
  (Blob already do that). The BlobProperty uses this new component
  now.


0.1 (2009-10-19)
----------------

* Initial release
